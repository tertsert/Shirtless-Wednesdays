        <p>Shirtless Wednesdays was founded by Michael Ryan —a production house that embodies passion, grit, and a refusal to take life too seriously. <br><br>We are the kind of people who bike to work and thrive on taking the next adventure one pinch, sloper, or crimp at a time. <br><br>We love the outdoors and documentary storytelling, willing to film in the middle of nowhere and make it look at least a little better than an iPhone. <br><br>Shirtless Wednesdays isn’t about perfection; it’s about embracing the chaos, capturing the real, and creating work that feels alive. If you want creative energy that’s equal parts daring and authentic, Shirtless Wednesdays has you covered.</p>
